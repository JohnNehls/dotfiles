#+title: Gnome Extensions

documenting extensions
- for now just the ones which do not have gnome 44 (fedora 38) versions

* ddterm
some form of drop down terminal is useful
- =`= is  activation key
   - though this does become an issue for bash and markdown


* Hide top bar
- for extra real estate
