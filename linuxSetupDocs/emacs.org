* Emacs client
Have the Emacs client running as a daemon so quick edits in the terminal are possible[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html][ gnu.org/emacs-server reference]]

1. enable daemon on boot
   #+begin_src shell
     systemctl --user enable emacs
   #+end_src
2. Maybe need start this time (since we have already booted up)
   #+begin_src shell
     systemctl --user start emacs.service
   #+end_src

** This keeps Emacs running and saves the state
After making changes to configuration, restart the daemon:
#+begin_src shell
  systemctl --user restart emacs.service
#+end_src
