#+TITLE: Hack Configuration

Be it known, here lies a fledgling Emacs configuration used for C++ and Python development as well as for general note taking and writing. The configuration is written in the /literate programming/ style via Org-Babel in the emacs.org file.

For a more thorough configuration see [[https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch]].

Note: the repository also stores my relatively basic =.bashrc= and =.ipython= (and maybe more) configurations.

* Installation
Execute the following commands starting wherever you'd like to place this repo:
#+begin_src bash
  git clone https://github.com/JohnNehls/.dotfiles
  cd .dotfiles
#+end_src

For the next step, there may be issues if our home directory already contains versions of configuration files we are now cloning-- rename or delete these files if we'd like them replaced. Then execute:
#+begin_src bash
stow . -t ~
#+end_src

Here [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][stow]] makes "symlinks" into the parent directory (here the home directory). Before creating the "symlinks", stow checks its =.stow-local-ignore= to find which files to ignore.

Next we launch Emacs. Since several modules are now compiled (Emacs native compilation), Emacs prompts us, type =yes= or =y= to continue. If there are issues (generally a missing a dependency in the system), a helpful message is displayed in the =*Messages*= buffer. Install the dependency, restart emacs, and compile again.

Before icons will display correctly in Emacs, we must run =M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts=.
