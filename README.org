#+TITLE: Hack Configuration

Be it known, here lies an [[https://raw.githack.com/JohnNehls/dotfiles/master/emacs.html][Emacs configuration]] and sparse [[./linuxSetupDocs][Linux setup notes]], the outline for my computational castle, all written in the /literate programming/ style via Org-Babel.

For a more thorough Emacs configuration see [[https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch][emacs-from-scratch]].

* Installation
Execute the following commands starting wherever you'd like to place this repo:
#+begin_src bash
  git clone https://github.com/JohnNehls/dotfiles
  cd dotfiles
#+end_src

For the next step, there may be issues if our home directory already contains versions of configuration files we are now cloning-- rename or delete these files if we'd like them replaced. Then execute:
#+begin_src bash
stow --dotfiles . # make symlinks into the parent directory (here the home directory).
emacs emacs.org
#+end_src
then =M-x org-babel-tangle= to tangle the configuration to =~/.emacs.d/init.el=.

Finally, before icons will display correctly in Emacs, we must run =M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts=.
